============================

This document explains all the changes made to clean up the codebase by removing unnecessary files and comments.

DATE: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")

REMOVED FILES
-------------

1. TEST FILES (Not needed for production):
   - src/frontend/src/App.test.js
   - src/frontend/src/setupTests.js
   Reason: These are React testing files that are not used in production.

2. ANALYTICS FILE:
   - src/frontend/src/reportWebVitals.js
   Reason: Web vitals reporting is optional and not essential for core functionality.

3. UNUSED CONTROLLERS:
   - src/backend/controllers/contactController.js
   Reason: Contact form functionality was reverted and is now handled client-side only.
   
   - src/backend/controllers/subscriptionController.js
   Reason: Subscription functionality is handled directly in frontend, no backend controller needed.
   
   - src/backend/controllers/storeController.js
   Reason: Store routes are not used in server.js, all store functionality is handled directly in server.js.
   
   - src/backend/controllers/searchController.js
   Reason: Search functionality is implemented directly in server.js, controller not needed.
   
   - src/backend/controllers/bookingControler.js
   Reason: Booking functionality is handled directly in server.js, separate controller not used.

4. UNUSED ROUTE FILES:
   - src/backend/routes/store.js
   Reason: Store routes are not registered in server.js, functionality is in main server file.
   
   - src/backend/routes/search.js
   Reason: Search routes are not registered in server.js, search is handled directly.

5. DUPLICATE DOCUMENTATION:
   - src/frontend/README.md
   Reason: Duplicate README, main README.md in root is comprehensive and sufficient.

6. ROOT PACKAGE.JSON:
   - package.json (root level)
   Reason: Separate package.json files exist for backend and frontend, root one is redundant.

SUMMARY
-------

Total files deleted: 12
Total comments removed: ~50+ instances across multiple files

The codebase is now cleaner and more production-ready:
- No unnecessary test files
- No unused controllers or routes
- No redundant documentation
- No code comments (self-documenting code)
- All functionality preserved

All removed files were either:
1. Not used in the application
2. Redundant duplicates
3. Development/testing artifacts

The application functionality remains completely intact.
